Vida Laboral has no fixed expiration date, but it is generally recommended to use a certificate from within the last 3 months, especially for official procedures.

### What if the information is incorrect?
If you find errors in your work records, please bring supporting documents (such as employment contracts, pay slips) to the Social Security office to request corrections.
