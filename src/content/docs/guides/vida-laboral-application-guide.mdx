## Frequently Asked Questions

### I don't have a Social Security Number (NAF). What should I do?
If you haven't worked in Spain before, you must first apply for a Social Security Number. Usually, your first employer handles this during the hiring process.

### How long is the certificate valid?
While there is no legal expiration date, most institutions (banks, immigration) require a certificate issued within the last **3 months**.

### What if my work history information is wrong?
If you spot an error, visit a Social Security office with supporting documents (contracts, payslips) to request a correction.

## Pro Tips

- **Keep it Digital**: Regularly save a copy of your Vida Laboral to your cloud storage or email.
- **Plan Ahead**: If you know you have an appointment coming up (e.g., for a visa), download a fresh copy a few days before.
